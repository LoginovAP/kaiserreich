However, an expert reporter of one of the national radio stations managed to press the minister into more or less confessing that he has not only lied to the public about his involvement, but also that he has been lying in front of the High Court on several occasions. Our political specialists tell us that this most probably will force the Head of Government to re-shuffle his cabinet.;;;;;;;На прошлой неделе вскрылись некоторые факты, касающиеся высокопоставленного лица в правительстве. На этой неделе министр, о котором шла речь, попытался публично опровергнуть обвинения. Однако опытный репортер одной из национальных радиостанций сумел раскопать факты, свидетельствующие о том, что министр не только публично лгал о своей невиновности, но и несколько раз солгал перед Верховным Судом. Наши политические аналитики считают, что глава государства будет вынужден отправить часть министров в отставку.;;;X

These core values have been abused by both Socialists and Conservatives in the effort to control and strangle the individual in our country. Let us therefore rebuild democracy.;;;;;;;Демократическое общество может процветать только в условиях свободы и справедливости. Этими основными ценностями пренебрегают и социалисты, и консерваторы. Они пытаются контролировать и душить индивидуальную свободу. Давайте вернемся к подлинной демократии.;;;X
EVT_5021_DESC;The Old Right talks about defense, but it is not defense they are planning for, but war. They are hawkish and arrogant. We need a professional defense of high quality, but our conviction is that peace can only be assured by means of diplomacy and international cooperation.;;;;;;;Правые снова говорят об обороне, но думают только о войне. Как всегда, они агрессивны и самоуверенны. Нам нужна хорошо обученная и профессиональная армия, но мир можно сохранить только путем дипломатии и международного сотрудничества.;;;X
EVT_5023_DESC;Our nation affirms the values of freedom and a free market. However, if 'freedom' is merely the right to choose where in this beautiful country one is free to starve, then we say no. We choose instead freedom and responsibility, which demand both a free market and a system of social security.;;;;;;;Мы ценим свободный рынок.

EVT_5041_DESC;We cherish the weaker members of our society and hold them dear.

Но если ограничение экономических свобод ведет к уменьшению общественного пирога из года в год, то было бы безответственно настаивать на равном распределении. Необходимо проводить сбалансированную экономическую политику.;;;X
EVT_5025_DESC;Warmongers have led our country for far too long. These are men who define the 'national interest' in terms of the number of foreigners they have trampled on. But we don't care about foreigners, we care only about our sons and daughters. We cannot accept them coming home in body bags. Thus, there will be no new wars. War must end.;;;;;;;Воинственные политики правили нами слишком долго. Этим людям кажется, что наши 'национальные интересы' заключаются в том, чтобы попирать интересы других государств. Нам нет дела до иностранцев, но нам небезразлична судьба наших сыновей и дочерей. Мы не хотим, чтобы они возвращались домой в гробах. Поэтому мы не хотим новых войн и требуем мира.;;;X
EVT_5031_DESC;We do not trust an army that represents bourgeois society. We demand instead a Workers' Army, an army that can promote peace, not war. Such an army will never fight outside our borders, because it acts solely for defense and not as a vehicle of international imperialist capitalism, in contrast to the current force of capitalist mercenaries.;;;;;;;Мы не доверяем буржуазной армии. Взамен нее мы требуем создать Рабочую Армию, которая будет стремиться к миру, а не к войне. Эта армия никогда не будет сражаться за пределами наших границ и никогда не станет орудием международного капитализма и империализма, в отличие от теперешней банды наемников капитала.;;;X
EVT_5033_DESC;The Capitalists are oppressing us with devilish new economic instruments, such as free Trade, no regulation of trade, minimal taxes, and of course, no policies to promote equality. This makes them nothing but butchers and tyrants. But we will use taxes as an instrument for leveling this society. The upper classes will disappear - this we promise.;;;;;;;Капиталисты душат рабочий класс при помощи новых дьявольских изобретений: свободного рынка, свободы торговли, минимальных налогов и, конечно, не заботятся о равенстве. Они просто убийцы и тираны. Мы же будем использовать налоги как инструмент установления равенства. Высших классов скоро не станет - мы твердо обещаем это.;;;X
EVT_5035_DESC;Our working comrades abroad face harsh pressure from both Capitalist and Fascist regmes. We must prepare ourselves for the final battle, for we cannot stand idly by while workers' governments are toppled one by one.;;;;;;;Наши братья по классу, иностранные рабочие, испытывают тяжкий гнет капиталистических и фашистских режимов. Мы должны готовиться к решающей схватке, ведь мы не можем просто смотреть, как враги свергают рабочие правительства поодиночке.;;;X
EVT_5037_DESC;The Old Right talks about freedom, but what they don't say is that it is only the freedom of some and not the freedom of the many. True freedom can only exist where society is truly equal. 'Liberal' freedom is a misnomer that must be corrected.;;;;;;;Правые снова говорят о свободе, но они молчат о том, это свобода для немногих и несвобода для большинства. Подлинная свобода существует только в государстве всеобщего равенства. 'Либеральная' свобода - это обман, и мы должны это исправить.;;;X
EVT_5039_DESC;The Capitalists and Aristocrats, with their greed and corruption, have nearly destroyed democracy. We have no intention of rebuilding the injustices of bourgeois pseudodemocracy. We will build a real democracy, in which capitalists and aristocrats will be held on a short leash.;;;;;;;Жадность и продажность капиталистов и аристократов поставили нашу демократию на край пропасти. Нам не нужно возвращаться к несправедливой буржуазной псевдодемократии. Мы построим подлинную демократию и укоротим загребущие руки капиталистов и аристократов.;;;X

EVT_TUCOPENED_DESC;The 1936 TUC Congress has been opened with much fanfare. This is the most important political event of the year, as it is now that new ministers are appointed and (although it is not explicitly mentioned) changes in Union policy are made and announced. This years congress will probably be a bit special though. Long-time TUC chairman Philip Snowden has long indicated that he intends to withdraw following this congress, and the stakes are high. Rivalling factions are forming behind the curtains, and the decentralizationist Authonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralizationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley), status quo socialist Federationists (Arthur Horner) and radical egalitarian paci-isolationist Congregationalists (Annie Kenney) are all wying for superiority in the TUC. Whatever the outcome, this will surely be a thing to remember...;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT666701_DESC;After the Franco- German war of 1870 to 1871, the Sedantag was established in Germany to celebrate the 1870 victory in the battle of Sedan. Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed under the reign of Wilhelm II into a day to celebrate the foundation of the German empire, and after the Weltkrieg the defeat of those forces that tried to destroy the Reich. Thoughout every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobilitiy, officers, soldiers, and unnumbered veterans parade proudly thought the streets, cheered by the happy masses. People sing patriotic songs, have pickniks with friends and family, play music, and dance around bonfires. Indeed, this is a good day, a day that reminds us of the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed since the german unification.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT666703_DESC;Luise Hoffmann was the first German woman to gain a pilot's license. After her 1933 transatlantic solo flight and her role as a scout pilot in the 1936 Neuschwabenland Expedition, she has become one of Germany's most famous aviation pioneers, along with notable pilots like Manfred von Richthofen, and Gunther Pluschow. Today, Fraulein Hoffmann has acomplished a new long distance record in her customized Fokker F-IX. Starting in Tahiti 36 hours ago, Fraulein Hoffmann today landed savely in Lae on German New Guinea, where she was welcomed by a jubilous crowd and governor Albert Hahl. It is rumored by now that Hoffmann will soon attempt a solo flight around the world. This would place her at a direct competition with the Red Baron who is planning a similar endeavour.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_123001_DESC;Today the Australasian Labour Party convened a special session in Sydney where the former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was readmitted into the party after having been excluded for 5 years. Lang was originally excluded as a result of his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW, Philip Game. A powerful orator and a populist through and through, the readmittance of Lang has caused consternation amongst the more leftist members of the Labour Party who alongside the majority of trade union activists see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labour Party is heading into a turbulent time.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_123002_DESC;Both Australia and New Zealand had a troubled relationship with the idea of conscription during the Weltkrieg. In Australia, two consecutive plebsticies about the introduction of conscription were narrowly defeated, leaving the ANZACs and other Antipodean units strictly volunteer-only. However, with the Entente’s defeat and the ensuring German expansion in the Pacific following the 1925 British Revolution, the federal government has been anxious about strengthening the fighting capabilities of the Australasian army, navy and air force. Today, the incumbent government of Billy Hughes has proposed increasing the military’s training strength and funding as a result of the rising tension in Europe and Asia. Some see it as a staging point for the government to launch a campaign arguing for the introduction of conscription and the need for a swift militarization of the Antipodean dominions.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_123003_DESC;The exiled ‘White Rajah’ of Sarawak and noted Sydney socialite, Charles Vyner Brooke has now openly begun to associate with the reactionary grouping known as ‘the New Guard’ led by Weltkrieg veteran Eric Campbell. Until now, the Guard has been a minor force in Australasian politics, but with their  forceful revanchist rhetoric and populist flair the movement has begun to spread its influence beyond New South Wales, especially gaining support amongst discharged servicemen and disgruntled officers. With Brooke’s charm and considerable monetary resources, the New Guard might just have gained the staging point for a showdown with the supposedly complacent and stagnating policies of Hughes and Bruce. The government should be prepared for any eventuality.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_123004_DESC;Conscription has always been a touchy subject in the Antipodean Dominions. Several governments had attempted to enforce it through plebiscites, but were defeated - sometimes narrowly - at the polling stations. However, several leading members of the incumbent administration argue that the time has come for a new attempt at replacing the volunteer ANZAC forces with a conscription-based and better trained armed forces. Such a ‘conscription campaign’ could either strengthen the government if successful or potentially break it - and thus strengthening the extremes of Australasia’s political scene - if failing. Either way, the amount of money the government is prepared to spend on this campaign will be an indicator of failure as well as success.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_123015_DESC;As the votes were being counted it soon became clear that the Yay-side would carry the day. However, complications have arisen since New Zealand overwhelmingly voted no to confederate conscription whilst Australians mainly voted yes. Although a majority for conscription has been achieved, it would be dangerous for our nation’s union to impose it on the New Zealanders. Some members of cabinet have proposed that we let the various administrative regions implement conscription on a local level, thus allowing the Kiwis to maintain their volunteer-based army units.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_123016_DESC;Since Jack Lang’s readmittance in February, the Labour Party has been steaming with internal disputes. Today, Lang struck back at the leftist members of the New South Wales party branch, successfully having them excluded alongside their Syndicalist-friendly trade union comrades from the party. This purge of the NSW party has since rippled throughout the Confederation with Lang’s supporters of moderate social populists and anti-Syndicalist union supporters ostracizing and marginalizing their more leftist opponents. This ‘Great Schism’ of the Australasian Labour Party has firmly separated the Antipodean worker’s movement into a reformist and populist rump Labour Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Yet all is not well in Labour since friction still exists between Lang and the popular John J. Curtin.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

Moreover, Europeans make up the majority of the population in major cities like Constantine and Oran, and the Arabs spread across the hinterlands and other cities.

EVT_755002_DESC;Brazil's fragile First Republic has been on the brink of its end since her humiliating defeat by Argentina on last year's war. The apparent stability represented by the 'Cafй com Leite' doctrine - the dominance of Brazilian politics by the landed oligarchies of Sгo Paulo and Minas Gerais - is revealing itself a farse, as general dissent against the federal government becomes more and more apparent. Old rivalries between different sectors of society are awaken. Unsatisfaction by the local elites of the South and Northeast against the government in Rio, and also by the industrialists in Sгo Paulo, is growing. The 'cangaзo' bandits, led by figures like Lampiгo and Corisco, are running rampant and harassing farmers in Cearб, Bahia and Pernambuco. The Brazilian Workers Confederation, an umbrella organization for the syndicalist movement, is sponsoring heavy labor strikes in the South-Southeast. Meanwhile, populist and nationalist thoughts are growing amongst the army and the middle class. Not even the armed forces can be trusted anymore: the 'Tenentes', the nonpartisan junior officers who organized the mutinies amongst the Army during the final stages of the war, can - and will - be mobilized by any side of the political spectrum. Emergency elections have been called for August, and some say that only a miracle can save democracy in Brazil.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_755003_DESC;This morning, the small city of Cruzeiro, Sгo Paulo, was visited by the remaining leaders of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB, Partido Comunista Brasileiro) as they organized their clandestine IV Party Congress. Founded in 1922 and much present on the very early days of the labour movement, the PCB is now a shadow of its former self, as a great part of its leaders and members have moved to other movements and parties, such as the Workers and Peasants Bloc (BOC, Bloco Operбrio e Camponкs), the Brazilian Workers' Confederation (CBT, Confederaзгo Brasileira dos Trabalhadores) and the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR, Partido Socialista Revolucionбrio). The strict adherence to the old Soviet Bolshevist doctrine by the party inner circle is seen by most as the main reason for its failure. With this in mind, the rump party voted by a great majority to dissolve itself and be absorved by the CBT. A small part of the old guard, however, led by Octбvio Brandгo, is keeping an eye on the developments of the Totalist ideas in Britain, and have already announced that the Party may be refounded on the near future.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_7550050_DESC;Due to the unstable political situation in our country, specially after our defeat on the Platine War, emergency elections have been called for the 1st of August. Four main coalitions are disputing: first, we have the Alianзa Nacional Libertadora (ANL, National Liberation Alliance), a broad front for the left-wing parties, composed of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the political sides of the BOC and CBT syndicates. Next, we have the Liberal-Democrats (Liberal-Democratas), an ad-hoc coalition of center-left and liberal forces under former president Jъlio Prestes, politically-experienced and presenting themselves as a moderate alternative to the present situation. Further to the right we have the Republicans (Republicanos), an union of conservative parties, joining landowners and industrial capitalists with the right-wing forces of the military under the leadership of populist Getъlio Vargas. The fourth main coalition are the authoritarian Brazilian Integralist Action (AIB, Aзгo Integralista Brasileira), the nationalist and populist party under Plнnio Salgado. After a very passionate campaign, the elections took place today. As the votes were counted, the next President of Brazil was announced...;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_755006_DESC;Despite all of the setbacks we have suffered on the previous years, the Alianзa Nacional Libertadora grand coalition has managed to elect Edgard Frederico Leuenroth, of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, as the next president of Brazil. The fifty-five year old journalist and long-time anarchist was one of the organizers of the general strikes in Sгo Paulo in 1917-1919, helping establish the anarcho-syndicalist movement in the country. He was seen, thus, by the ANL leadership, as their obvious candidate for the presidency. And today is his inauguration day! Despite what some purists think, we may be forced to work on a coalition with some left-wing elements of Liberal-Democrats to appease some parts of the middle classes. A much more palatable solution for us would be asking the left-wing Tenentes into our coalition. Others, however, still think we can handle the whole government all by ourselves.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_755007_DESC;At least until we enact a new constitution, the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil).

All the three main parties of the ANL have put forward their own candidates for the post. Lнvio Xavier of the BOC, Astrogildo Pereira of the CBT, and Joгo da Costa Pimenta of the PSR. So, who shall we choose?;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_755008_DESC;We were assured that the Brazilian people still believes on democracy. Jъlio Prestes, president from 1930 to 1934, will return to office. Despite all the mess which has been brought to the country by the incompetence of the present government and by extremists from the right and left, the very institutions upon which the Federative Republic has been laid down were not shaken. And we know democracy is all about negotiating and laying alliances, right? Some parts of our bloc believe in asking the center-left elements of the military into our coalition, which will appease the armed forces. Others, however, think that inviting Getъlio Vargas and his Republicans would calm down the landowners and other conservative forces. So, what shall we choose?;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_755009_DESC;Although the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Washington Luнs, president from 1926 to 1930, supported Jъlio Prestes both on his 1930 campaign and on this year, so he would be a most likely choice. Two other candidates must also be considered, however: former Piauн governor Olнmpio de Melo and Borges de Medeiros, the traditional gaъcho politician. Choosing a chief of staff from a smaller state, instead of the paulista Washington Luнs, would grant us a greater support base among the traditionalist classes, altough we will miss the former president's political expertise.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_755010_DESC;Tradition has scored a victory. The people of Brazil has chosen Getъlio Vargas of the Republican bloc as the new president. Coming from a traditional rancher family of the southern Pampas, Vargas was seen by his coalition as a compromise candidate, appeasing the landowners from the South, Southeast and Northeast, the industrial bourgeoisie and, thanks to him states rights platform, the whole range of conservative forces. Plus, his populist speeches also seduced a portion of the proletariat, thanks to his promises of new labour laws and a more efficient social security system. Now, for a even more effective governing of Brazil, we must consider some political alliances with the other voting blocs. Should Vargas attempt a deal with the right-wing Tenentes led by Eurico Gaspar Dutra, his old friend from his time on the army? Some, however, are dreaming about a coalition with the nationalist Aзгo Integralista Brasileira. Despite the obvious differences between the pro-states rights Republicanos and the autoritharian AIB, some of their policies are perfectly compatible with ours.

However, it would be wise to form a coalition government with like-minded politicians... Inviting the more far-right elements of the armed forces would be a nice move, according to some.

EVT_755014_DESC;Brazil was hit hard by the Berlin Stock Market Crash, as the country has a heavy dependence on foreign markets and loans. Despite the industrial development in Sгo Paulo, the export of coffee and other primary products is still the mainstay of the economy. Days after the Berlin stock market crash, coffee quotations immediately fell 30 percent. Now, while we still are the government of Brazil, we must take a decision. Sticking to the principles preached by the foreign bankers may preserve our economy from some of the worse effects of the crisis, but will anger the people even more.

EVT_755017_DESC;We will now face our first challenge: how to deal with the current economical crisis? Our cabinet believes that the first steps must be taken on the fields. Since the beggining of the Berlin panic, world demand for our agricultural products has fallen dramatically, and the grand landowners (mainly the sugar and coffee barons) are struck with unsellable harvests. Soon more and more poor peasants will either starve or look for better opportunities in the cities, while the landowners will take the opportunity to blame the federal government for not helping them out of the mess.

On their constant fighting against the landowners' thugs, sometimes for their own personal glory, sometimes for a sincere protection of the poorer peasants, labeled either as heroes or bandits, the cangaceiros are an integral part of the complex social-political landscape of the northeastern states. One of the column's members, a devoted Marxist of the PSR, lectured both the Coluna and the cangaceiros on how the movement can be seen as an spontaneous revolutionary movement of the poor men and women against the feudal opression of the coronйis.

EVT_755024_DESC;After dozens of surveys during the past months, a comission made up of members of the BOC, CBT and PSR, led by Minervino de Oliveira, has produced a white paper detailing three main plans for agrarian reform in Brazil. 'Plan A', defended by the BOC, proposes the collectivization of all arable land and their reorganization into smallers plots, headed by the peasants themselves, who will then organize and combine into cooperatives to sell their produce. The CBT-supported 'Plan B' sees the confiscation of all land by the federal government and its reorganization into grand state farms employing the majority of the rural population. There's still one more possibility, the 'Plan C' defended by the PSR. This third, more moderate option, proposes the collectivization of all the bigger farms and lands, while leaving the medium-sized and smaller lands still as private property. Plan C also defends the confiscation of unused plots and their reorganization into cooperatives - a system similar to the Ejidos adopted by Mexico after their revolution.

EVT_755036_DESC;Representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture met today in Recife with a delegation of state governors led by Pernambuco's Carlos de Lima Cavalcanti. The central government demands a greater cooperation of the conservative forces to our socialist reforms - something that the reactionaries find an insult. The governors, on the other hand, want less pressure from Rio and the option to a less severe application of the land reforms. With this conservative initiative receiving more and more support from the northeastern elites, any concession may be seen as a threat to our progressive policies and will be regarded by other sectors of society as a sign of weakness by our government.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

EVT_755039_DESC;Some local and foreign investors have been looking towards our public companies. Most Brazilian industries are owned by the private initiative, but the federal and state governments do control some key areas, such as the national banks, the harbours, and some electricity and water distribution companies. Some economists say that these enterprises are somewhat of a money drain to the state, big and unnefective companies diverting capital that would see better use in other areas. So, why don't we share these troubles with the private initiative? We could promote the establishment of public-private partnerships and make some of our companies into mixed-capital ventures. That way, we could use the expertise of the industrial capitalists but work them on a socialist framework. Orthodox Marxist economists, however, defend that we should keep these companies entirelly with us, since they were established with taxpayers money and thus belong to the people and the state of Brazil.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

The CBT syndicate has organized a four-hour-long strike in Rio de Janeiro demanding a review of these policies. Minervino de Oliveira, a leading figure of the CBT, proposes the transformation of more companies into cooperatives. According to him, if we give up some control of our companies and divert these responsabilities to the factory managers and to the workers themselves, they will come up with smartest decisions - better than handling every single local problem to a bureaucrat far away in Rio!

EVT_755058_DESC;A small socialist meeting on a factory in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro turned to an unexpected direction as the place was invaded by a band of Greenshirts, the paramilitary arm of the Brazilian Integralist Action.

These latifъndios, however, also hold many unused plots, which could very well be occupied by landless farmers. One of our congressmen has put forward a proposal for a land reform programme which would distribute this empty land among poorer peasants. Not only this would increase our agricultural output, but since we would be adressing a key issue for the peasants, their support for the more radical syndicalist movements is likely to decrease.

Vargas himself has called the group to Rio de Janeiro to assure there's nothing to worry about. These measures will be useful to diminish the popularity of the extremist socialist movements amongst the peasants and even the urban proletariat - after all, why should they put their faith on a syndicate like the BOC if the federal government itself is fulfilling their needs?

EVT_755079_DESC;After so many economical reforms, the industralists and landowners want to know something once and for all: what is their role on the Integralist state? Our doctrine stipulates that Capitalism is a doctrine as harmfull to society as Socialism, since free market allows for the accumulation of capital in the hands of just a few individuals. However, these capitalists are much necessary for our society and for the stability of our regime, so it could be wise to accomodate them in our structure.

EVT_755080_DESC;The trade unions of Brazil, specially those aligned with the two main syndicates of the country (the CBT and the BOC), have been a major issue for our Integralist regime. While the core leadership of these organizations is made of commited socialists and have been an active opposition towards our government, their power is being diluted as more and more as the workers are sympatizing with our cause. However, this support is tenuous at most, as the bulk of these proletarians can revert to socialism at any greater sign of crisis. With this in mind, our cabinet has proposed three different solutions to this issue. Filinto Mьller of the Federal Police proposes a simple crackdown and dissolution of the trade unions! If we force these organizations underground, their political power will simply dissapear. Our Ministry of Industry proposes instead that we simply replace their leadership with more loyal workers. By putting Integralist proletarians in power, we will be sure of the continuous support of the unions to our doctrine. The core of our regime, however, made of Plнnio Salgado and other theorists like Gustavo Barroso and Miguel Reale, defend the integration of the syndicates on our government structure.

Many members of the Patrianovistas are also sympatizers (when not full members) of the Brazilian Integralist Action. The opposite is also true, with a few commited Integralists being also high-ranking Patrianovistas. Veiga dos Santos, now, has proposed a full merging of both movements, with the Patrianovistas becoming full members of the AIB. No matter how tempting this proposal may seem, we must take a careful approach.

Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern’s demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government.

EVT_3968549_DESC;Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope therefore demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporativism is just beginning.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

His plan dubbed Kaiserbund project proposes transformation of the current German colonial empire into the chain of dependent territories with limited international sovereignity. Such quasi states would allow economically troubled German Empire to gradually reduce colonial administration in favor of the local one, or even completely replace it, while German Empire would retain control over executive power, armed forces, foreign relations and economy of these newborn states. German Emperor would be formal head of state while head of the executive power would be nominated by the Emperor and approved in Reichstag.

The British textile and clothing trades, in particular, employed far more women than men and could be regarded as 'women's work'. While some women managed to raditional career paths, for the most part women were expected to be primarily involved in 'duties at home' and 'women's work'. Before 1914, only a few countries (New Zealand, Australia, and several Scandinavian nations) had given the right to vote to women, and apart from these countries women were little involved in the political process. With millions of men away fighting and with the inevitable horrendous casualties, there was a severe shortage of labour in a range of industries, from rural and farm work to city office jobs. During both Weltkriegs, women were called on, by necessity, to do work and to take on roles that were outside their traditional gender expectations.

EVT_101068_DESC;More than a decade after the Bolshevik rebellion, the central government has finally extinguished the fire of radical socialism on the sub-continent. Columns upon columns of marching soldiers and cohorts of trucks, tanks and armoured cars penetrate the interior of the Communard state, cementing our control over the vanquished usurper territory. However sweet this victory might seem, the cabinet is faced with a huge array of problems and issues facing our new administration. For the better of a decade's worth of time, the provinces of the Bengal, Orissa and Assam were subject to relatively strict socialist governance with the large estates of the elite expropriated, zamindars eliminated and the large tea plantations nationalized. We must replace this system of oppression and terror with a new kind of administration that will win the hearts and minds of the depraved peasants and workers of Eastern India.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101069_DESC;Some of the largest industries in all of India, the vast tea plantations of Assam have functioned as staggering  state owned entities until the downfall of Bolshevism in India. Now, the plantations are suffering under the strains of war and misadministration - resulting in poor production rates and massive dissatisfaction amongst the workers.

EVT_101073_DESC;One of the Eastern provinces seized by the rebels in Calcutta in the chaotic days of the Raj, Orissa was at the time of the Bolshevik conquest characterized by the large numbers of native princely states. Although these petty rulers never rivalled Hyderabad or Kashmir in power, the Calcutta government was quick to expropriate and prosecute the zamindars and rajas of the province. Quite a few of these royal йmigrйs sought refuge in Delhi, hoping one day to return to their estates and palaces. With the arrival of our troops in Orissa, that wish has now come true. However, a decade of socialist management has collectivized and divided a great deal of the йmigrйs' estates with huge amounts of peasants and workers depending on the land to survive. The reactionaries within our state crave vengeance and a forceful return to the way of the 'Ancien Regime' whilst the moderates counsel restraint and compromise. Either way, the Government's choice certainly will determine our status as either liberators or conquerors.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101077_DESC;The Bengal was one of the most populous and prosperous of the Raj's many provinces. Heavily industrialized by Indian standards, the Bengal was also one of the first of Britain's Indian possessions to be majorly affected by socialist unrest. When the Raj collapsed, the Bengal proved a willing base of operations for Bose's campaign against Delhi and Hyderabad. In the ten years passing between the civil war and our conquest of the Calcutta Government, the massive industrial complexes of the Bengal have been expanded with help from the Union of Britain and a delicate bureaucracy of socialist administration put in place. Now these industrial behemoths lie in ruins after our troops swept through the province and different proposals have been presented as to how they can be brought back into shape. However, these industries proved a vital part in the social organization of the Bengal and a rapid restructure might harm our claim to legal rulership.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

The edict and its author have been hailed by progressives throughout the southernmost princely state, and a great deal of others, for the humane and magnanimous act of lifting the deprived and struggling towards greater self esteem and communal respect. However, a great deal of the more conservative Hindu landlords and nawabs throughout the Federation are disgruntled at this sudden leap of modernity, fearing their control over the less fortunate might slip away amidst such edicts of equality. For now, though, the legal changes remain confined to the princely state of Travancore-Cochin.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101103_DESC;If India was the jewel in the crown of British Imperialism, then the eloquent network of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway was the jewel within it. Originally constructed in 1853, it was the model upon which the Raj built its massive infrastructure of transportation, much envied by the rest of Asia and an inspiration for noted author Jules Verne. Renamed the Hyderabad-Deccan Railroad following the British withdrawal from southern India, this awe inspiring piece of engineering and logistics have sadly fallen into a state of decay. However, today a commission of experts backed by the southern gun-salute princes has addressed the Council with a plan for the expansion and renovation of what has been dubbed ‘... the artery of administration in the Deccan’ - stretching the lines of rail all the way from Bombay to Cape Comorin.

However, Osman’s executive power has since been restricted, with the southern princes in Mysore and Travancore resenting any Hyderabadi hegemony. But with the threat of left-over British imperialism and socialist agitation on the rise in the north, the Nizam has come to the conclusion that for Princely India to survive, maybe even unite the remnants of the Raj, reform must be undertaken. Osman’s supporters hope that their champion assume imperial authority - continuing the style of the Mughals and queen Victoria. Others agree that reform is needed, but under a liberalized legislature, favouring the Hindu majority and the southern maharajas.

A direct proclamation that the Hyderabadi Nizam considers our own claim to legal rulership over the previous Raj as lower than the basest fiction! This bombastic claim has, besides obviously degrading our own state, severely upset the delicate balance of power in the South. Rumours are afloat that a great amount of southern princes are deeply offended at such a unilateral show of arrogance. Whilst some define the Nizam's illusions of grandeur as nothing but domestic squabbling, some foreign experts within our own corridors of powers speculate that imminent confrontation might soon erupt between the various nominally independent princely states within the Federation.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

The chief sycophants within the Nizam’s inner circle, now readily urges him to completely do away with this relic of administration and appoint a new national prime minister to handle the matters of state.

Barring religious differences, Osman Ali Khan and the king of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV had long had conflicting views on the level of centralisation of the Federation. Following the Nizam’s claim to Imperial regalia, these differences have come to the front, with the Wadiyar maharaja angrily denouncing Osman’s scheming and disregard for the federal constitution as a de facto coup de etat. Seeing no other way, the chief prince of the South has declared his domain independent and the union of necessity that once bound the erstwhile British princely states south of the Deccan Plateau together - dead and gone.

Now, however, Osman Ali Khan’s Hyderabad government is facing extraordinary threats.

EVT_101122_DESC;A legislative chamber where membership is hereditary, the Council of Princes has guided the gun-salute nation in its day to day business since the southern rajas rebelled against the Delhi government. However, pressure from the depressed masses since our limited liberalisation of the legislature has pressed the cabinet to address the issues of the Council. Some believe that the fig-leaf constitutionalism of the princely administration might be strengthened by creating a unified post for running the day to day affairs of the government. However, whether or not this position should be reserved for those of royal birth or made open for commoners as well is still a sore subject along the corridors of power.

However, Travancore-Cochin's Temple Entry Proclamation has greatly lessened the suffering of the state's avarnas and given them a new sense of communal pride.

However, there have been calls for a new grand and unitary Maratha Princely State with the same rights as Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore-Cochin in the Council of Princes. The so called State of Maharashtra would be of imposing size and industrial capacity, but ruled by a college of the various Maratha petty princes in unison. Within the larger and older princely states, there is much opposition to the creation of a new powerful federal state which could counter the interests of the established order.

Now, however, the fields lay in disrepair. Like most everything else in the late socialist republic, we now have to make a tough decision regarding the future of this business.

EVT_1012515_DESC;With the revolution secured at home, it is now time to turn our gaze to the rest of occupied Asia. Indochina is one of the nearest examples of continued European colonialism, having been conquered by the French at the turn of the last century, before being handed over to the Germans after the Entente’s defeat in the Weltkrieg. However, because of the chaotic circumstances of the Kaiserreich’s takeover, the Germans never quite managed to secure themselves in the role as colonial masters, which has resulted in the colony witnessing several uprisings of various nationalist groupings. Should we initiate support for the leftist and anti-colonialist movements within Indochina?;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

With the establishment of socialist power in India, we now have a solid base of operations to dislodge European colonialism from the Orient. However, given the island’s strategic value for the Germans, it might be difficult for us to expel them peacefully.

EVT_101201_DESC;Lala Lajpat Rai, president of the Indian National Congress and head of the Calcutta government, has begun to feel the strain of his advanced age creeping ever nearer. With the British lapdogs in Delhi reemerging as a serious contender to the mantle of the Raj's legal successor and the Burmese monarchy rattled by student protests and strikes, Rai has concluded that the government of free India will have to be refitted and reorganized if we are to keep up with the development of our neighbouring rivals - and as such he has decided to step down from his position. Rai’s resignation marks a potential end to the compromise government that emerged after the Indian Civil War, with both Gandhi’s moderates and Subhas Chandra Bose’s Maximists longing for definitive influence within Congress and the Calcutta government as a whole. Regardless, this Special Session called by Rai has been set for late january 1937.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101202_DESC;Calcutta is steaming with excitement in the face of the 1937 Special Session of the Indian National Congress and the red flag flutters boldly from Writers’ Building to the General Post Office. Inside the Calcutta High Court, the collected leadership of our republic’s government has convened for the ensuing election of Lala Lajpat Rai’s successor. It is expected that the appointment of a new head of state will mean a fresh gush of change within the nation’s cabinet, prompting the various fractions to scuttle for the floor in order to garner the most influence in all the various commissaries and committees that manage our country. Three wings have emerged within Congress. Bose’s Maximists emulate Mosley’s British Totalitarian Socialism and regard military force as a necessary revolutionary act for India’s unification whilst Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi leads a pacifist, egalitarian and agrarian wing - striving for a negotiated end to the subcontinent’s fragmentation. Standing between the two extremes is a coalition of trade unionists and ardent proponents of industrialism led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and his young protege Jawaharlal Nehru. As the opening speeches begin to ring across the floor, the 1937 Special Session seems bound to change the path of free India in the next years.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101203_DESC;Although the greatest landowners and princes of Bengal and Orissa were deposed and their fiefs expropriated after the Calcutta government asserted itself in the years following 1926, the Bhartiya Commune never truly made the transformation into a socialist society. Lingering still in the villages and the smaller cities, the Zamindar system of the olden days continue to shape the days and lives of those who should have been lifted into prosperity by the glorious revolution almost a decade ago. Subhas Chandra Bose has taken the floor and delivered a crushing speech against this feudal instrument of oppression, demanding an immediate end to the privately owned great farms and mansions and their subjugation to complete state control. A sensitive issue, the debate on the rights of the remaining landlords have begun to spin out of control and a decision will have to be made.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101204_DESC;At the end of the first week of the Special Session, young Jawaharlal Nehru has taken the floor, arguing for a further increase in our nation’s industrial output and greater economic control by the state. Opposed to this, stand the Gandhian wing of Congress, determined as they are that the heart and soul of Mother India is not her great cities, but the Harlequinesque patchwork of rural villages from Cape Comorin to the Mouth of the Indus. Accordingly, they believe that the influx of state support should flow into the countryside, developing the rice paddies and benefitting the average Indian. The Maximists, on the other hand, find both Nehru and Gandhi’s proposals far too limited in their scope and hopelessly unambitious. Instead, Bose’s supporters argue that the state is more than capable of undertaking expansion in both sectors, requiring, of course, that the government absolutely control these endeavours.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101205_DESC;Despite the fact that the Indian National Congress managed to rally the nationalist and revolutionary movement behind itself during the Indian Civil War, opposition from the rival governments in Delhi and Hyderabad meant that Calcutta only managed to secure Bengal, Assam and northern Orissa before the war winded down. Since then, the Bhartiya Commune has been at peace with her neighbours, but with changes in both Burma, Delhi and in the gun-salute prince’s federation, unfolding at a unnerving pace, it is obvious that the special session will have to address the lingering question of unification. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, always a staunch opponent of violence, supports a negotiated end to to the division of the subcontinent. Given how hard the revolutionaries had to fight during last days of the Raj, this stance is rather controversial and both Huq and Bose find the notion all but treacherous. Nehru argues that the government should wage realpolitik and take opportunities as they come whilst Bose has bombastically announced that neither Nizam nor Dominion shall obtain any concession.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101206_DESC;After much deliberation and exhausting debates, the Special Session of Congress has finally endorsed the platform proposed by Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists. The venerable war hero now ascends to absolute leadership within the Calcutta government bringing with him a following of idealist and radicalized socialists. Gandhi is appalled at this blatant endorsement of violence and his left Calcutta for his ashram, giving Bose a benevolent audience for his acceptance speech. With the internal division now solved, our rivals around the continent will certainly have cause for worry!;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

Greatly frustrating to the ageing Lala Lajpat Rai, who hoped to deliver the fate of Free India into secure hands, the venerable leader has completely resigned any influence in the bogged down political metamorphosis. In his stead as mediator, both Bose and Gandhi frantically attempt to appeal to young Jawaharlal Nehru for support, at least creating some semblance of coalition.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101212_DESC;The workers at the Yenangyaung Oil Fields were the primus motor of the recent Burmese revolution. Their strike against the capitalist system of robbery and oppression was what galvanized the latent dissatisfaction with the Konbaung dynasty into a fullscale uprising within both the military and the general populace. As the Burmese republic ascended to the Bhartiya Commune it now falls upon our government to determine how the means of production in Yenangyaung should be handled. The Anarcho-Syndicalist wing of the Indian National Congress argue that the local trade unions, being the true representatives of the local workers, ought to take full control of the oil fields. On the other hand, Bose's Maximists present a strong argument for complete state control and involvement in the day to day running of the plants.

Seeing both Bose’s Maximist and Gandhi’s agrarian wings as compromised and Fazlul Huq’s centrists as corrupt, the group hopes to contest for commissary and delegate positions on the next round of elections to the government. Invoking the name old name ‘Anushilan Samiti’ (meaning ‘Self-Culture Association’) the group strongly advocates the use of force to overthrow the Hyderabad and Delhi governments as well as an economic system based on anarcho-syndicalist policies of cooperative farming and union controlled industries.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

EVT_101215_DESC;With the war between the Indian states successfully concluded, we now have to determine how to integrate the provinces previously administered by the reactionaries into our state.

EVT_101216_DESC;The provinces of the vanquished reactionary states were organized in a predictably feudal manner. Princes administered some whilst others fell under bourgeoisie control. Before venturing into debating what concrete political changes should be made to the societal structure of our new domains, Congress must first decide how to administer the new districts. Bose’s Maximists argue for large blocs of coherent ethno-linguistic provinces together forming the backbone of the centralized state, whilst Gandhi’s Agrarians take the opposite stance and recommend smaller sub-state entities controlled by local village communes. Nehru’s industrialists favour middle-sized linguistic states modelled on traditional provincial divisions whilst Dange’s Anarcho-Syndicalists suggest a union of council-driven provinces created by popular referendums. As the delegates take the floor the first debate on the future of India is about to unfold!;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101217_DESC;Prevalent throughout non-Socialist India, but especially in the Princely Federation, the zamindari system was a feudal institution of exploitation where landlords held economic and social power over the workers and farmers working on their factories and estates. With our liberation of the suffering proletariat Congress now has to decide what to do with the means of production. The Maximists argue for swift centralization, the Agrarians as always favour local village authority, the Industrialists demand a balance of central and local ownership whilst Dange’s wing suggest orthodox Syndicalist theories of trade-union control as the solution to the administration of the liberated economic institutions.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101218_DESC;The Indian sub-continent is as diverse economically as it is ethnically and religiously. The merchants in Bombay and Karachi thrive on foreign trade through the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez, whilst the peasants of the Gangetic Plain toil mainly for themselves and their local communities. It is thus extremely complex to tailor an economic policy that is able to cover all the various business and enterprise strata. However, that is just what Subhas Chandra Bose is proposing. Envisaging a total state involvement in all layers of business, the Maximists claim that only such drastic measures can ensure the total eradication of the capitalist society and the substantiation of a true egalitarian and socialist India. Naturally, the other wings of Congress beg to differ…;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_101219_DESC;As the army finished off its last opponents, the military consequently took on the role as a force of occupation. This is in some cases discouraging for our newly liberated brothers, as the presence of army patrols make us look not as the liberators of the proletariat, but rather as foreign invaders.

EVT_101220_DESC;A veritable mass of patterns of different ethnicities, religious and caste sub groupings, Indian politics have always swayed between the extremes of cultural accommodation and subjection.

All parties agree that minority rights are essential, however, the means of enforcing these in the far more traditional and conservative provinces recently liberated from reactionary rule seem to be far more difficult to agree upon.

Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi’s official residence in Calcutta.

EVT_923000_DESC;Ethiopia, also known as Abyssinia, was the only African state which managed to remain independent during the XIXth century Scramble for Africa, succesfully defeating an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory kickstarted the proccess of modernization in the Ethiopian Empire, in order to bring the country close to European standards regarding its economy, army and administration. In 1918, under empress Zauditu, the Ethiopian Empire entered the Weitkrieg on the side of the Germans, succesfully annexing the Italian colonies of Somaliland and Eritrea. Another sign of Ethiopia's modernization was the expansion of the DPAEB railroad, a vital transport link for the country. In 1930, Empress Zauditu died with no surviving children, which prompted her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen to ascend the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to start a new series of reforms to bring Ethiopia 'into the west'. These initiatives, however, were fiercely opposed by the conservative nobility of the nation, who had been greatly strengthened by the annexation of the Italian colonies and the subsequent expansion of the army. Haile Selassie also faces opposition from the important Italian business community in Eritrea, who feel that any disturbance to the status quo will mean an end to their privileges.

EVT_610015_DESC;Totalism, also known as Totalitarian Socialism, is an authoritarian interpretation of communist and syndicalist ideology currently promoted by some important European socialists, such as Benito Mussolini from Italy and Oswald Mosley from the Union of Britain. Totalism puts a great emphasis on the establishment of a strong and centralized state in order to properly defend the socialist revolution. Critics, however, say that Totalism is a repressive tool that will, ultimately, lead to a degeneration of the socialist ideals and the establishment of a bureaucratic class who will take any steps necessary in order to stay in power... Despite these critics, our own president follows a similar interpretation of socialism, so maybe it's time to officially endorse Totalism?;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

Die Gartenlaube, newspaper owned by Alfred Hugenberg, reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with syndicalist intelligence. Shortly after Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, didn't find out that family of war minister's associate was infiltrated by hostile intelligence.

Alas, bloodthirsty hordes of soldiers and militiamen have been unleashed from all parts of the German Empire and are now ravaging Lorraine. Many Syndicalists have been executed after hast mock trials and French-speaking civilians are fleeing west up to the French border, where facilities have been built to welcome these refugees.

However, brute force is now suppressing the Lorrains struggle for freedom and social justice and despite undecover help from our intelligence services, the German police,supported by army detachements, has put hundreds under arrest, while extrajudicial executions have been reported in Longwy and mining cities are under martial law.

The German people will not accept to give in to such endless and unbased claims ; however, the military situation is deteriorating fast as French commando units have successfully crossed the border in at least four occasions, even if for a short time, and have made contact with French-speaking militants in Lothringen ; so it might be wiser to agree to pay these reparations and ease the tension with the Commune.";;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

The Agrarian Wing, on the contrary, argue that the complex nature of the Indian nation calls for a loose confederation of states with the executive only permitted supreme control of defense matters and All-Indian industries. Dange’s Anarcho-Syndicalist share Gandhi’s mistrust of a strong central government, but suggest creating a coordinating States Committee elected by local trade unions to ensure some coherence amongst India’s provinces.

EVT_830081_DESC;A Syndicalist government now rules in Dublin. While this has been greeted with trepidation by the press and the general public, members of our General Staff and Military Intelligence see opportunity. In their haste to subdue Collins' regime the Unionists may have created an opening that we may exploit. Support for the King remains strong in the north, Collins was unable to subdue the loyalist elements fully and the reds will likely fare no better. By secretly supplying arms and equipment to loyal factions in Ulster we could count on them, once the war with the Syndicalist dogs comes, to rise up for our cause. In doing so they might secure for us a foothold in Ireland, putting us within reach our ultimate goal, the restoration of our United Kingdom! Intelligence has also contacted several groups opposed to the new Irish government in the south. While these are no allies of Collins and his IRA, the are still Republicans. Made up of avowed anti-syndicalists and supporters of the National Centre Party and Fianna Fбil who have been forced underground. If we were to help arm and organise these disparate groups into an 'Irish National Army' it would greatly increase our chances of success, but would upset members of the loyalist militias who wish for a return of the monarchy to Ireland as well as members of our armed forces for whom the memories of the Irish War are not easily forgotten.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_890004_DESC;After successfully ousting the Liberal's from office, the new Coalition government quickly set about the task of producing their own defence bill. Bill C-8 as it is known, was heavily influenced by the British Exiles, prioritising conscription as well as increasing the ability of Canada's security forces to deal with any perceived left wing infiltration. The SocCred coalition partners focused on the nationalisation of certain key industries in preparation for the future implementation of Social Credit policy.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_890025_DESC;Social Credit is an economic philosophy that was developed by Clifford Hugh Douglas during the Weltkrieg, believing that the current economic system was designed to create a plutocracy through unnecessary scarcity and that the workers needed to be freed from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production. Douglas' reform program containted two main elements, a national dividend to distribute money equally to all citizens to bridge the gap between earning power and prices, and a price adjustment mechanism that would forestall the possibility of inflation. Now that we are in power, we can work to implement these ideas throughout the nation. However critics have accused Social Credit of being 'syndicalistic' and as such it would perhaps be wise to moderate our plans lest they draw anger.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X
EVT_890027_DESC;The Imperial Broadcasting Service was founded by Sir John Reith in 1926 after the British Revolution, when his previous broadcasting organisation, the British Broadcasting Corporation founded in 1922 after the Weltkrieg, was taken over by the Syndicalists. The broadcasting service has proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire towards our common goal of reviving the United Kingdom as well as marginalising Syndicalism within our borders. After the debacle over Bill C-7 there have been calls to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists who it has been claimed are at fault for 'sabotaging' the bill. Others, noting increasing international tensions, have suggested aligning our propaganda towards a more external focus to prepare our people for the coming fight against Syndicalism.;;;;;;;#TODO;;;X

At that point, the funds could be liquidated and serve as an stimulus to encourage consumer spending for the economy transitioning to peacetime activity.

Они также полезны в качестве средства борьбы с инфляцией в сверхстимулируемых экономиках через вывод денег из обращения до успешного окончания войны. Тогда эти средства могут быть выплачены и будут служитт стимулом для поощрения потребительских расходов при переходе к мирной деятельности.
