EVT_9000081_DESC;After our occupation of Alaska several of our industries moved in to exploit the area. One of these has, after an intensive survey, managed to discover a large oil field at Prudhoe Bay on the northern coastline.

The city would undergo a massive transformation, new streets and buildings would make it the most modern city in the Americas and a massive shipyard would make it the hub of trade in the south.

Both Long and Reed denounced the crackdown as nothing more than an attempt to eradicate opposing views. Protests against the move were launched throughout the country and Reed was threatening a general strike. The America First attacked government officials and burned government buildings.;

EVT_800309_NAME;Chaos in America;
EVT_800309_DESC;With the withdrawal of his troops, MacArthur had lost control of the country and armed militia units were popping up to defy the United States ;
EVT_800309_OPTIONA;Depose MacArthur;
EVT_800309_OPTIONB;He will pull through;
EVT_800310_NAME;The Days of Violence;
EVT_800310_DESC;The days leading up the election were marred by violence as both the America First and CSA protested their ban from the election. Anarchist groups attacked government buildings and America First supporters denounced the election as nothing more than a joke. While Reed and the CSA threatened a general strike if the election did not include them, the America First rallied around Long who used his position in the senate to demand his inclusion in the election.;
EVT_800310_OPTIONA;The ban stands!;
EVT_800310_OPTIONB;Lift the ban.;
EVT_800311_NAME;Declaration of Martial Law;
EVT_800311_DESC;To get control of the situation, MacArthur declared Martial Law. Martial Law caused a serious amount of dissent as barricade began going up throughout the country.;
EVT_800311_OPTIONA;Not good.;
EVT_800169_NAME;MacArthur proposes assassination of Long.;
EVT_800169_DESC;MacArthur privately met with the President today and made a shocking proposal- the assassination of Huey Long. Analysis of
reports from spies from within the America First Party indicated that the entire movement would tear itself apart without his 
charismatic leadership, and while it might lead to extensive rioting, it was definitely preferable to an organized uprising, which 
appeared more and more likely as the days wore on.;
EVT_800169_OPTIONA;This is far too dangerous.;
EVT_800169_OPTIONB;Do it.;
EVT_800170_NAME;Huey Long is dead!;
EVT_800170_DESC;Shortly before noon in Atlanta, as Long was delivering a speech in front of the Capitol building, he was shot by two
different snipers. He was pronounced DOA at Grady Memorial Hospital. The city quickly descended into rioting and protests erupted
across the rest of the south and midwest over the course of the day.;
EVT_800170_OPTIONA;This is awful, but at least we won't be fighting a civil war.;
EVT_800171_NAME;Peace at last!;
EVT_800171_DESC;With the America First Party broken as a political force and the Combined Syndicates satisfied with our reforms, the
political crisis in the country appears to have passed. The world is still a dangerous place and our focus in foreign affairs will
have to be decided eventually, but for now we can rest easy.;
EVT_800171_OPTIONA;God bless the U.S.A.!;
EVT_906600_NAME;Jack Reed's Death;
EVT_906600_DESC;After a long illness, Chairman John 'Jack' Reed of the Combined Sydicates of America has passed away. An autopsy revealed
that he died of a brain hemorrhage caused by a heart tumor.;
EVT_906600_OPTIONA;Momento Mori.;
EVT_906601_NAME;The Independence of the Phillippines;
EVT_906601_DESC;As per the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, the time has come to grant the Phillippines their independence. The Navy will miss
its bases, although we will not miss the trouble of running the place.;
EVT_906601_OPTIONA;Farewell Manila.;
EVT_906604_NAME;The Combined Syndicates abandon Presidential politics.;
EVT_906604_DESC;General Secretary Thomas of the Combined Syndicates of America announced today that that the organization will not be
running a candidate for President in 1944, and will focus on Congressional and state-level politics. This is not a surprising
development, coming on the heels of Chairman Reed's death, Thomas' failure to carry a single state last November, and rumors of
friction between the various factions of the CSA.;
EVT_906604_OPTIONA;Interesting.;
EVT_906605_NAME;Lindbergh and his family leave for Canada.;
EVT_906605_DESC;Charles Lindbergh, formerly Chairman of the America First Union Party, departed by train yesterday morning with his wife and
son for Ottawa. Hounded by the press and under investigation by the federal government, he has evidently decided to journey north, 
but it is not certain where he will eventually settle.;
EVT_906605_OPTIONA;Hopefully he won't come back for a long time.;
EVT_800172_NAME;Economic Recovery;
EVT_800172_DESC;For the first time in over a decade, our economists are reporting an overwhelmingly positive outlook for the fiscal year. The redistributive reforms we made back in February have caused aggregate demand to skyrocket, shoring up business in general, and the unemployment rate has dropped to single digits!;
EVT_800172_OPTIONA;Happy days are here again!;
EVT_800173_NAME;Further Economic Recovery;
EVT_800173_DESC;With the incredibly violent state the world is in, nations have turned to our comparatively stable industries for trade in everything from household goods to artillery. At this rate, our economists believe we will surpass Germany in industrial output for the first time since 1925.;
EVT_800173_OPTIONA;OK;
