EVT_750800_NAME;The Claims of Armenian Archeology;
EVT_750800_DESC;A heated debate has raged in Armenian academic circles recently, on the issue of the greatest extent of Armenian state and cultural influence. Armenian archeologists have unearthed traces of art and implements of an Armenia character in Eastern Turkey, but others are claiming that Armenian culture spread much further. We can finance some more expeditions to clarify the issue, yet this might bring us trouble from the Ottoman authorities;

EVT_750811_NAME;Ban on Teaching;
EVT_750811_DESC;In an attempt to further the assimilation of the Armenian people into the Ottoman society the Armenian government has banned the teaching of Armenian written literature calling it biased and inaccurate.

EVT_750816_DESC;The Armenians have arrested several of the people who were responsible for the unrest there. They have requested that we send in troops to put down the unrest that has arisen due to the arrests.
