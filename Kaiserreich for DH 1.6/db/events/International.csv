EVT_100000_DESC;On this twentieth day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions.

EVT_100000_OPTIONA;Max.: We must fight the reactionaries wherever we find them;
EVT_100000_OPTIONB;Aut.: We must take a reconcialitory position towards the Royalists;
EVT_100000_OPTIONC;Fed.: Canada is our mortal enemy, and France is our good friend;

EVT_1100013_NAME;Sébastien Faure's resignation;
EVT_1100013_DESC;During the inauguration cerenomy of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, BGT Chairman Sébastien Faure claimed that the triumph of Anarchist values was also his, and thus refused to step down from his position. For Nestor Makhno, to who Guérin had promised the post, it's a snub, considering it as an evidence of French xenophobia. The BGT members now have to vote to avoid a fight between Makhno the soldier and Faure the thinker.;

EVT_661002_DESC;The major issue regarding internal policy is the reform of the current system and the way we deal with opposition. The Travailleurs support liberalisation and democratisation along the lines of the British system; the Sorelians consider that the current compromise is better and would like to keep an eye on liberal dissent; the Anarchistes favor a more open society but oppose any rightist deviation of the Commune; the Jacobins, finally, demand that the central government is reinforced.;
